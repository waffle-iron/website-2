                                Once of the common feedback we found during meetups is, most meetup cover theory. To give some practical experience of Git, there will be short workshop (45 minutes) where we will practice the commands we covered during sessions. For this, everyone will create their own git-hub account and a sample project. We will use proper Git workflow to practice managing dummy source code.<br/><br/>

                    <p>August 2nd, 2014</p>

                        Most important factors for a web application are:
                        <br/><br/>
                        • Performance<br/>
                        • Maintainability<br/>
                        • Scalability<br/>
                        • Reliability and<br/>
                        • Security
                        <br/><br/>
                        Among developers, Security is one of the most ignored topics. In this session, we will discuss some of the common security threats for a web application and how we can fix them.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Web Security is technology/language independent topic and most of the session will not use any specific programming language. Thus any web developer is most invited to attend the event. However please note, towards the end, we will use simple PHP examples to demonstrate how can we practically take care of security issues.
